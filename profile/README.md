Hey, I'm happy you are making a change! 

Make sure to follow the simple rule of making a pull request, rather than a commit to main.

Pull requests make things a lot smoother, so it would be much appreciated!

Also, all pull requests from members outside of this organization *will* be rejected!

Thank you! - Johang
